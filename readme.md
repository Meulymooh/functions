# Functions

No link. PHP exercises, the server-related instructions won't work.

Exercise not finished.

## What I learned

* Include and require: https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_includes.asp


## Difficulties

* When using "include", leave the "action" tag empty in order to not get redirected to the result page: https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/t/when-you-use-the-include-function-and-click-submit-it-goes-to-the-included-file-php/206768

* I didn't understand the "object_revert" details. What I did is based on my interpretation, but it doesn't look very in line with the instructions.

* I didn't do the last instruction. 

## Feedback

I didn't understand anything of the instructions for creating the 3 functions. It's not human language and it's not precise enough. Before starting the exercise we should be able to visualize the output of the exercise. Raf and Anton explained to me the "object_revert" instruction, but they both interpreted it a different way.
