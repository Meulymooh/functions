No link. PHP exercises, the server-related instructions won't work.

* I didn't understand anything of the instruction for creating 3 functions. It's not human language. That's why before starting the exercise we should be able to visualize an output. 

* When using "include", leave the "action" tag empty to not get redirected to the result page: https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/t/when-you-use-the-include-function-and-click-submit-it-goes-to-the-included-file-php/206768
