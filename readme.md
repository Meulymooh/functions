# Functions

No link. PHP exercises, the server-related instructions won't work.

## What I learned


## Difficulties

* Because my code from the Nickname exercise was a mess, I only used it in the function "nickname_generate". I wrote new code for "object_generate".


## Feedback

* I didn't understand anything of the instruction for creating 3 functions. It's not human language. That's why before starting the exercise we should be able to visualize an output. Raf explained to me what we had to do.

* When using "include", leave the "action" tag empty to not get redirected to the result page: https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/t/when-you-use-the-include-function-and-click-submit-it-goes-to-the-included-file-php/206768
